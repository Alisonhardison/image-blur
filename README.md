# Coding Challenges
  Highlighting and covering complex algorithmic coding challenges in preparation to build web applications with the same level of complexity that exist in the real world. 

## Challenge: Image Blur 1
  -   Taking the concept of an Image and build a class for it using object-oriented programming techniques. The Image will use a two-dimentional array to store the pixel values for the image.

## Challenge: Image Blur 2
  -   From base of [Image Blur 1], building a data transformation on a data representation of an image. This will continue to work with object-oriented programming and multidimensional arrays.
  
## Challenge: Image Blur 3
  -   From base of [Image Blur 2], building an even more complex data transformation on the implementation of an image. This will continue to work with object-oriented programming and multidimensional arrays.
